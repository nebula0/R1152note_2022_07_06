[[Efficient protoplast isolation and transient gene expression system for Phalaenopsis hybrid cultivar ‘Ruili Beauty’.pdf]]

### Protoplast Isolation
#### material
-  Phalaenopsis hybrid cultivar ‘Ruili Beauty’
-  young leaves of aseptically grown plantlets
-  cut into 0.5–1.0-mm strips
#### solution and procedure
##### solution
- 0.4 M D-mannitol
- enzymes and osmotic regulator
	- 1.0% (w/v) Cellulase Onozuka R-10(Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd., Tokyo,Japan)
	- 0.7% (w/v) Macerozyme R-10 (Yakult Honsha Co.)
	- 0.4 M D-mannitol
	-  pH 5.6
- CPW-9 M
	- 9% (w/v) D-mannitol
	- CPW salts
		- $KH_2PO_4$ 27.2 mg/L
		- $KNO_3$ 101 mg /L
		- $CaCl_2$·2H2O 1480 mg/L
		- $MgSO_4$·7H2O 246 mg/L
		- $KI$ 0.16 mg/L
		- $CuSO_4$·5H2O 0.025 mg/L
- 15–25% (_w/v_) sucrose gradient^[how to prepare]
##### procedure
1. 10 ml D-mannitol for 1 g tissue
2. submerged leaf strips to `0.4 M D-mannitol` for` 1 h`
3. transfer 1 g leaf into `enzymes and osmotic regulato` at 25 $^{\circ}$C in darkness with `rotation of 0.1 g` for `6 hr` in Erlenmeyer flask
4. filtered through a `200-μm mesh sieve`
5. centrifuged at `100g` for `8 min`  (at room temperature)
6. resuspended in `5 mL CPW-9 M`
7. centrifuged, resuspended step repeat twice
8. resuspend protoplast pellet in `1.0 mL CPW-9 M`
9. floated on the surface of a `15–25% (_w/v_) sucrose gradient`
10. centrifuged at `100 g` for `5 min`(at room temperature)
11. resuspended protoplast layer in `1.0 mL of CPW-9 M`
12. diluted `with CPW-9M `(1:3, _v/v_)
### note
> In preliminary experiments, it was found that the growth stage of leaves and growth condition of the aseptic plants were critical for successful protoplast isolation

> juvenile leaves of healthy ‘Ruili Beauty’ plants were the best starting material

- enzyme concentration
- mannitol concentration
- enzyme digestion duration
