## Mean-variance relationship
![](attachment/Pasted%20image%2020220705104535.png)
The variance is greater than the mean in this data, indicating overdispersion. Dashed line = regression line. [ref](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Mean-variance-relationships-for-different-models-A-normal-model-assumes-that-the_fig1_275248713)

## overdispersion 
When the observed variance is higher than the variance of a theoretical model, overdispersion has occurred. Conversely, underdispersion means that there was less variation in the data than predicted. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdispersion)
