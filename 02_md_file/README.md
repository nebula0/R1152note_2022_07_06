This is a personal lab work note for R1152. 
The files in this repository are notes in my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). So if you want a better reading experience, you may need to download Obsidian and [Git](https://git-scm.com/), clone https://github.com/nebula0/R1152note.git on your Obsidian desktop.
