## function
_in vitro_  protein synthesis fluorescence microscopy or high-content imaging

## principle
- O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) [^ref1]^[https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/C10456]
	- ![[Pasted image 20220507114830.png]]
	- storage -20°C
	- clickable form of the protein synthesis inhibitor  [[puromycin]]
	- forms covalent adducts and terminates chain elongation on the ribosome ^[到底是抑制還是嵌進去，還是牽進去後抑制]
	- has been used in combination with fluorescent azides to image nascent proteins in various cells
- Alexa Fluor™ 488 picolyl azide
- other necessary reagent
- add OPP, OPP incorporated into tissue, pivolyl azide and other reagent react with OPP, protein synthesis can be detect.
