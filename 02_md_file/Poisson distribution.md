$$f(x;\lambda) = P(X = x) = \cfrac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{x}}{k!}$$
$k$ number of occurrence
$\lambda$ expected value of $X$
- mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ are equal to $\lambda$ 
- poisson distribution no upper bond
- if lambda  is big, distribution will be more symmetry

- example
	-  the number of meteorites greater than 1 meter diameter that strike Earth in a year
