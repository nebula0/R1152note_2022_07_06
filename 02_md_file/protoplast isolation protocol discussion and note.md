enzyme (cellulose, macerozyme) concentration in the paper [`Cymbidium petal paper`](02_md_file/Highly%20Efficient%20Protoplast%20Isolation%20and%20Transient%20Expression%20System%20for%20Functional%20Characterization%20of%20Flowering%20Related%20Genes%20in%20_Cymbidium_%20Orchids.md) is higher than that in paper [`Phalaenopsis petal paper`](02_md_file/A%20Protoplast%20Transient%20Expression%20System%20to%20Enable%20Molecular,%20Cellular,%20and%20Functional%20Studies%20in%20_Phalaenopsis_%20orchids.md)

maybe it is because _Cymbidium_ leaf was harder to digest, since it were hard leather-like texture and _Phalanopsis_ were fleshy.^[Highly Efficient Leaf Base Protoplast

Important Monocot Crops]

D-mannitol concentration also different, 0.5 M, 0.7 M for `Cymbidium petal paper`,  `Phalaenopsis petal paper`, respectively.

`Phalaenopsis petal paper` add Carbenicillin to prevent bacteria contamination but `Cymbidium petal paper` not.

`Phalaenopsis petal paper` incubate tissue in enzyme solution for longer time (16h compare to 6h), and only this paper in four papers didn't rotate when digesting tissue.

the solution for dilute and resuspending protoplast, `Phalaenopsis petal paper` use WI-0.7 that contain salt and mannitol, `Cymbidium petal paper` use  W5 that doesn't contain mannitol, and use MMG which contains mannitol to adjust protoplast concentration.

other variables are similar.

`Phalaenopsis leaf paper` didn't add MES. It's kind of weird.
Many other difference in this two paper, I don't know how to compare them QQ/
