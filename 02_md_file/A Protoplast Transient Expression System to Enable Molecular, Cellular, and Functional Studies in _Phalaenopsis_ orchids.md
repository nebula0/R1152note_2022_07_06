Phalaenopsis aphrodite 白蝴蝶蘭


---
### Protoplast Isolation
#### material
- _Phalaenopsis aphrodite subsp. formosana_
- petals collected 1–15 days after full bloom
- cut into 0.5–1.0-mm strips
#### solution and procedure
##### solution
- enzyme solution
	- 1% (w/v) cellulase R-10 (Yakult Pharmaceutical)
	- 0.25% (w/v) macerozyme R-10 (Yakult Pharmaceutical)
	- 0.7 M (or otherwise described in the Results) mannitol (Sigma)
	- 20 mM $KCl$ (Sigma)
	- 20 mM MES (pH 5.7, Sigma)
- 10 mM $CaCl_2$ and 0.1% BSA (Sigma cat #A7906)
- Carbenicillin, final concentration will be 50 µg/ml ^[avoid bacterial contamination]
- WI-0.7
	- 0.7 M mannitol (or as described in the section “Results”)
	- 20 mM KCl
	- 4 mM MES (pH 5.7)

##### procedure
1. `enzyme solution` warmed up to 55◦C for 10 min^[enhance enzyme solubility and to inactivate DNase and protease]，cool to room temperature
2. add `10 mM CaCl2 and 0.1% BSA`
3. filtered and sterilized by `0.45 µm Millex-HP filter (Millipore)`
4. submerged petal strips to enzyme mixture
5. digest without agitation in the dark for approximately `16 h`
6. add `Carbenicillin` to final concentration `50 µg/ml`
7. gently agitated enzyme mixture to release the protoplasts
8. dilute with equal volume `WI-0.7` 
9. filtered through a `100-µm nylon mesh (BD Falcon) `^[mesh is normally kept in 95% ethanol and rinsed with WI-0.7 solution before use]
10. centrifuged at `200 g` for `2 min`, acceleration ramp was set to 2 and deceleration ramp was set to 0
11. remove supernatant
12. resuspended pellet in `3 ml WI-0.7 solution`
13. washed gently one more time with `3 ml WI-0.7 solution` (?)

### dye
Propidium iodide, PI
![](../attachment/Pasted%20image%2020220630152503.png)
- not membrane-permeable -> test if cell alive
- stain nucleic acids (intercalating between the bases), can also bind to RNA
- excitation maximum: 493 nm (blue-green)
- emission(binding): 535 nm (green) / 617 nm (orange-red)


### change variable
- osmotic conditions set by mannitol can test
- resuspension solution (MMG-0.6, MMG-0.7, WI-0.7) can test
