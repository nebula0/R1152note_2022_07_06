[[Highly Efficient Leaf Base Protoplast Isolation and Transient Expression Systems for Orchids and Other Important Monocot Crops.pdf]]

### Protoplast Isolation
#### material
- Cymbidium
	- pedicels
	- young leaves
	- leaf base 
	- young root tips
- Phalaenopsis leaf base
- Paphiopedilum leaf base
- Dendrobium leaf base
- Arundina leaf base
- rice and maize leaf base
- cut into 0.5–1.0 mm strips or slices
#### solution and procedure
##### solution
- enzyme solution
	- 20 mM $KCl$ (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, United States)
	- 20 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (pH 5.7) (Sigma)
	- D-mannitol (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 M) (Sigma)
	- cellulose R-10 (0.6, 1.2 and 2.4, w/v)
	- macerozyme R-10 (0.3, 0.6, and 1.2%, w/v)
- 0.1% BSA
	- 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma)
- w5
	- 154 mM $NaCl$ (Sigma)
	- 125 mM $CaCl_2$
	- 5 mM $KCl$
	- 4 mM MES (pH = 5.7)
##### procedure
1. 10 ml enzyme for 0.5 g tissue
2. surface sterilized tissue for `3 min` in `75% ethyl alcohol or`, five washes by sterilized water
3. `enzyme solution` warmed up to 55◦C for 10 min, cool to room temperature
4. add `10 mM CaCl2 and 0.1% BSA`
5. add  `2-mercaptoethanol (0, 1, 2, 5, and 10 mM)`
6. submerged strips to enzyme mixture(immediately after cut)
7. incubation at `28°C` in the `dark` with a `rotation of 30 rpm` for `different periods (2, 4, 6, and 8 h)`
8. dilute with equal volume `W5`
9. filtered through a `150 μm nylon mesh` into a 50 mL round-bottomed centrifuge
10. centrifuged at `100 g` for `2 min`(at room temperature)
11. remove supernatant with a sterile syringe( as much as possible)
12. re-suspended in `20 mL ofW5 solution` 

### note
- this paper has a table summarized many protocols from other research

> excess enzymes led to the phytotoxicity of enzymes on the membrane of
protoplasts

> The major factors affecting protoplast preparation are osmotic pressure, enzymatic concentration, and their combination in the
enzyme solution

> Peroxides released by the ruptured protoplasts could also damage the protoplasts (de Marco and Roubelakis-Angelakis, 1996; Yasuda et al., 2007). To address these problems and protect protoplasts from rupturing, a suitable concentration of the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the enzyme solution. The protoplast yields markedly increased with the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol



### question
> Then, 10 mM CaCl2 (Sigma), and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma) were added to different concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol (0,
1, 2, 5, and 10 mM) (Sigma).

Does it mean add them to enzyme solution?
Concentration means final or initial? If it means initial, what volume should we add?
