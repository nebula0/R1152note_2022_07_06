### population mean and population standard deviation are known:

$$z = \cfrac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

$\mu$: mean of population
$\sigma$: standard deviation of the population

### standardized version(?)
$$Z = \cfrac{\bar X - E[\bar X]}{\sigma(X)/\sqrt{n}}$$


$E[X]$: expected value
$\bar X$: sample mean
$n$: sample size

(?)
why we divide the population standard deviation, sigma, by the square root of the sample size
![](../attachment/Pasted%20image%2020220715104046.png)

sample standard error divide by square root of sample size will close to population standard deviation.
$\sigma_{\bar x} = \cfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
